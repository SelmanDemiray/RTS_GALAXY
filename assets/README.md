### Advanced Animation System

#### Building State Animations
Each building type has animations that reflect its current operational state:

1. **Construction Phase**
   - Duration: 2-4 seconds
   - Shows scaffolding, sparks, construction activity
   - Transitions to operational when complete

2. **Operational States**
   - **Idle**: Baseline operational animations
   - **Active Work**: Enhanced activity during production/research
   - **Emergency**: High-alert, rapid activity animations
   - **Maintenance**: Periodic upkeep activities

3. **Damage States**
   - **Light Damage**: Smoke effects, flickering lights
   - **Heavy Damage**: Fire, sparks, structural damage
   - **Destroyed**: Collapse sequence, explosion effects

4. **Special Function Animations**
   - **Power Buildings**: Energy surges, cooling cycles
   - **Production Buildings**: Assembly lines, deployment sequences
   - **Defense Buildings**: Targeting, firing, reloading
   - **Research Buildings**: Experiments, data processing

#### Animation Triggers
Animations are triggered by various game events:

- **Construction**: Building placement and construction progress
- **Production**: Unit training, research projects
- **Combat**: Under attack, firing weapons
- **Resource State**: Power levels, resource availability
- **Upgrade**: Building improvements and modifications

### Building Integration with Gameplay

#### Power System
- Buildings consume/generate power
- Insufficient power triggers low-power animations
- Power surges activate overcharge animations

#### Damage System
- Progressive damage states with visual feedback
- Repair animations when being restored
- Destruction sequences for eliminated buildings

#### Production Feedback
- Visual cues for unit production progress
- Deployment animations for completed units
- Queue indicators for pending production

### Asset Creation Guidelines

#### Visual Consistency
- Maintain faction-specific architectural styles
- Use consistent material and lighting approaches
- Ensure animations support gameplay feedback

#### Performance Optimization
- LOD system for distant buildings
- Animation culling for off-screen structures
- Efficient texture usage across building types

#### Technical Standards
- All buildings export as .glb with embedded textures
- Animation frame rate: 30 FPS
- Proper pivot points for rotation and scaling
- Efficient polygon usage within specified limits

This enhanced building system provides rich visual feedback, diverse strategic options, and immersive base-building gameplay through detailed 3D models and comprehensive animation systems.
